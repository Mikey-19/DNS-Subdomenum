DNS + Subdomain Enumeration Tool (GUI)
 Introduction

The DNS + Subdomain Enumeration Tool is a modern GUI-based application built with Python and PyQt5.
It allows cybersecurity students, penetration testers, and researchers to perform DNS lookups and brute-force subdomain discovery in an easy-to-use interface.

This tool combines the power of DNS record resolution with subdomain enumeration, making it a handy utility for reconnaissance and information gathering.

 Features

Resolve DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT)

Perform subdomain brute-forcing using a custom wordlist

Multithreaded scanning for speed and efficiency

Modern GUI with Dark/Light themes

Real-time results displayed in tables

Export results to CSV for reporting

 Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mikey-19/DNS-Subdomenum.git
```

Navigate into the folder:
```bash
